Welcome to WankOS
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started turning your device into a pile of wank, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Slim7 trees, use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/WankOS/platform_manifest.git -b w7.1



Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
